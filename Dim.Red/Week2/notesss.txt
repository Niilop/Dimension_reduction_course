Make a list that will collect all the indices (that correspond to attributes)

attributes (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)

attribute x3 is the best so the index_list is now (2,)


attributes (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)

if i in index_list -> skip

attribute x4 is the best so index_list is now (2,3)
